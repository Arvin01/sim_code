This folder contains simulations under the Ghosh and Dunson (2009) like model, except with linked variances and factor variances.

I use the V6P version of GTEX to do this

I adjust for library size using the pre-processed pre-poisson thinned
count matrix. I use the entire count matrix, not just the count matrix
of the top 1000. Here, I include the 75th percentile of the log-counts
as a covariate.
